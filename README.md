## 📸 Adding Product Photos

1. Open the product form (Add or Edit)
2. Click the photo area — a file picker opens
3. Select a JPG, PNG, or WEBP image (max 2MB)
4. The preview shows instantly
5. Save the product

Photos are stored directly in the browser (as base64). They stay saved permanently in the browser's localStorage.

> **Note:** Since photos are stored in the browser, they are device-specific. If you open the site on a different computer, the photos won't appear until you upload them again on that device. For a permanent photo solution, consider upgrading to a backend (Netlify CMS, Firebase, etc.)

## 📐 V-Belt Size Charts

When adding/editing a V-Belt (or any product with sizes):

2. Enter column headers (e.g. Belt No., Outside Length, Inside Length, Price)
3. Click **+ Add Row** for each belt size
4. Save

Customers will see a full scrollable size table in the product detail popup.

## 💡 Tips

- **Backup your data:** In Admin → Settings, use browser DevTools → Application → localStorage to export if needed
- **Multiple devices:** Product data is stored per-browser. Changes on your phone won't appear on your PC automatically
- **Photo sizes:** Keep images under 500KB for best performance. Resize with tools like [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app)
- **Custom domain:** GitHub Pages supports custom domains (e.g. indotechsupply.com) for free

## 🔒 Security Note

This is a client-side admin panel — the password is stored in the browser. It's suitable for a small business catalog. For higher security needs (e.g. preventing customers from viewing admin.html source), consider a server-based CMS.
